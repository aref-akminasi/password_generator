## Background
I had the choice to work on a project to develop a program related to the minor Visual Design & Front-End Development at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
The idea behind this project was that I wanted to build an application that would help me learn more JavaScript while building it and give users the ability to use it to benefit them while they were using the Internet. I worked on this project on my own :coffee:

## Thanks
I would like to thank Paul Kuijpers and Reyber Turgut who guided me through this project :relaxed:
